Project Description

This is a small project developed in Java SE to help strengthen my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The project has a main menu that checks if the user is a doctor, nurse, or patient and gives access to different tasks based on their role. It uses important OOP concepts like class inheritance, method overloading, and encapsulation.
